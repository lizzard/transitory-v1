Interactive fiction in progress.

You will also need to install several Inform7 extensions. From within Inform7, there is an option in the File menu on macOS, "Show Installed Extensions Folder". Make a folder named "Emily Short" in there and Put the Transit System file in it. 

Instructions: http://dhayton.haverford.edu/wp-content/uploads/Inform-manuals/WI_2_10.html

You'll need to download these 2 extensions and put them into the proper folder, inside folders named after the author:

Transit System by Emily Short.
Exit Lister by Eric Eve.

Note: This also uses a modified version of Touchy Feely by Quantum Games, temporarily included in the main body of the game.
