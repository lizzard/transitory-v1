# transitory
Interactive fiction in progress. Transitory is a text adventure game that 
takes place in the San Francisco Bay Area, on and around the BART train system,
past, present, and future. Exploring the landscape and the intersections of 
magic, art, and technology lead the player to five puzzles corresponding with 
the five BART train lines. My aim is to make a super fun game that deepens
people's relationship with the everyday geography they may experience. So,
when you ride the real life train, you may start to notice the aesthetics
of the stations, the characters of the neighborhoods around them, and think 
about the history of the land. The familiar will become new, and the train
rider will become more aware of possible futures just around the corner.

As an added dimension to the game experience, the player can choose to play as
a wheelchair user, Deaf or hard of hearing, blind or having low vision, or any 
combination of those disabilities. Representation in media buoys us up; as I 
experimented with writing game scenarios from the point of view of a wheelchair
user, I had a powerfully happy feeling. I'd like to make the game playable in 
an interesting way from many points of view; the world must be navigable and 
the clues findable for all of them. As I play with that it is also fun to put 
in the sly crip humor that is a key piece of our everyday resistance and 
survival. 

INSTALLING THE GAME

To playtest, install Inform7 and clone this repo.

You will also need to install an Inform7 extension, Transit System by Emily
Short. From within Inform7, there is an option in the File menu on macOS,
"Show Installed Extensions Folder". Make a folder named "Emily Short" in there
and put the Transit System file in it. 

Instructions: http://dhayton.haverford.edu/wp-content/uploads/Inform-manuals/WI_2_10.html

You'll need to download the extension and put it into the proper folder, 
inside folders named after the author:

Transit System by Emily Short.

Note: This also uses a modified version of Touchy Feely by Quantum Games, temporarily included in the main body of the game.
