Interactive fiction in progress.

You will also need to install several Inform7 extensions. From within Inform7, there is an option in the File menu on macOS, "Show Installed Extensions Folder". Make a folder named "Emily Short" in there and Put the Transit System file in it. 

Instructions: http://dhayton.haverford.edu/wp-content/uploads/Inform-manuals/WI_2_10.html

You'll need to download these 2 extensions and put them into the proper folder, inside folders named after the author:

Transit System by Emily Short.
Touchy Feely by Quantum Games.  
Note: (I may need to replace Touchy Feely or explain how to fix, as it has a couple of buggy lines)

Download from:

Rideable Vehicles by Graham Nelson should already be included in Inform7 but if it isn't you can download and install it.
