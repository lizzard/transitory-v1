Transitory
An Interactive Fiction by lizzard
Release 1 / Serial number 190120 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Calle 24 Southwest Plaza
Little tables and tent-covered booths are scattered throughout this busy plaza, with people selling souvenirs from Mexico and Guatemala, shopping bags, embroidered huipil blouses, woolen ponchos, phone chargers and cases, jewelry, and flowers. Many kinds of music are playing here - norteño blasts its cheerful accordions from speakers at a booth, saxophone notes float up from the huge, round stairwell which goes down to the station, songs blare from passing cars. There is a sloping area useful as a stage underneath the Coffee and Mission mural. Across 24th street to the north, there's a donut shop.

You can see a flower seller here.

Mission 24th Concourse
Enormous concrete buttresses soar overhead, like a futuristic 70s airplane hangar. Music echoes hauntingly from a monumental stairwell rising up to the plaza, combining with the wild harmonics of trains below. There is an elevator to the platform to the north, and another elevator to the street to the northwest.

Calle 24 Northeast Plaza
Palm trees sway high overhead. Delicate metal rails surround the enormous circular stairwell that goes down to the station concourse. All around you are little shops, restaurants, taquerias, people talking, buses pulling up to the stops on Mission and on 24th Street, music blasting from cars going by. A huge mural runs across the wall of the taqueria bordering the plaza to the north, of a gleaming BART train carried on the backs of determined workers amid a geometric cityscape.

You can see a tamale lady, a yelling preacher and a flower seller here.

This lively streetcorner just outside the Chinese Food and Donuts shop has buses pulling up along 24th Street, many cars going by, people crossing the street and just standing around, music blaring from passing cars and from the shops all around. Along Mission, tall washingtonia palms spring into the sky.

Mission 24th St
You are underground, on a BART platform. The hollow sound of vibrating train rails echoes through the station. Boxy concrete arches run overhead and then frame the sides of the train tunnel. An elevator is in the median wall to the north. On the platform itself, the floor is covered with long brick-red tiles, while the median walls are tiled in muted orange, gold, and brown, like a desert sunset.

Just outside the Chinese Food and Donuts shop, this lively streetcorner has buses pulling up along 24th Street, many cars going by, people crossing the street and just standing around, music blaring from passing cars and from the shops all around. Along Mission, high overhead, washingtonia palms stretch into the sky. To the east, there's another BART plaza with an elevator.

Calle 24 Northeast Plaza
Palm trees sway high overhead. Delicate metal rails surround the enormous circular stairwell that goes down to the station concourse. All around you are little shops, restaurants, taquerias, people talking, buses pulling up to the stops on Mission and on 24th Street, music blasting from cars going by. A huge mural runs across the wall of the taqueria bordering the plaza to the north, of a gleaming BART train carried on the backs of determined workers amid a geometric cityscape.

You can see a tamale lady and a yelling preacher here.

You are underground, on a BART platform. The hollow sound of vibrating train rails echoes through the station. Boxy concrete arches run overhead and then frame the sides of the train tunnel. An elevator is in the median wall to the north. On the platform itself, the floor is covered with long brick-red tiles, while the median walls are tiled in muted orange, gold, and brown, like a desert sunset.

Calle 24 Southeast Corner
This busy street corner by the McDonalds is grimy. It's basically a crowded spot where people wait to cross the street. Across Mission to the west, there's a nice plaza with a busy market. Across 24th Street to the north, another lovely plaza with musicians, preachers, and some places to sit.

Palm trees sway high overhead. Delicate metal rails surround the enormous circular stairwell that goes down to the station concourse. All around you are little shops, restaurants, taquerias, people talking, buses pulling up to the stops on Mission and on 24th Street, music blasting from cars going by. A huge mural runs across the wall of the taqueria bordering the plaza to the north, of a gleaming BART train carried on the backs of determined workers amid a geometric cityscape.

Calle 24 Northwest Corner
Just outside the Chinese Food and Donuts shop, this lively streetcorner has buses pulling up along 24th Street, many cars going by, people crossing the street and just standing around, music blaring from passing cars and from the shops all around. Along Mission, high overhead, washingtonia palms stretch into the sky. To the east, there's another BART plaza with an elevator.

Mission 24th St
You are underground, on a BART platform. The hollow sound of vibrating train rails echoes through the station. Boxy concrete arches run overhead and then frame the sides of the train tunnel. An elevator is in the median wall to the north. On the platform itself, the floor is covered with long brick-red tiles, while the median walls are tiled in muted orange, gold, and brown, like a desert sunset.

You can see an elevator (empty) here.

Mission 24th Concourse (in the elevator)
Enormous concrete buttresses soar overhead, like a futuristic 70s airplane hangar. Music echoes hauntingly from a monumental stairwell rising up to the plaza, combining with the wild harmonics of trains below. There is an elevator to the platform to the north, and another elevator to the street to the northwest.

Palm trees sway high overhead. Delicate metal rails surround the enormous circular stairwell that goes down to the station concourse. All around you are little shops, restaurants, taquerias, people talking, buses pulling up to the stops on Mission and on 24th Street, music blasting from cars going by. A huge mural runs across the wall of the taqueria bordering the plaza to the north, of a gleaming BART train carried on the backs of determined workers amid a geometric cityscape.

You are underground, on a BART platform. The hollow sound of vibrating train rails echoes through the station. Boxy concrete arches run overhead and then frame the sides of the train tunnel. An elevator is in the median wall to the north. On the platform itself, the floor is covered with long brick-red tiles, while the median walls are tiled in muted orange, gold, and brown, like a desert sunset.

Calle 24 Northeast Plaza
Palm trees sway high overhead. Delicate metal rails surround the enormous circular stairwell that goes down to the station concourse. All around you are little shops, restaurants, taquerias, people talking, buses pulling up to the stops on Mission and on 24th Street, music blasting from cars going by. A huge mural runs across the wall of the taqueria bordering the plaza to the north, of a gleaming BART train carried on the backs of determined workers amid a geometric cityscape.

You can see a tamale lady and a yelling preacher here.

Calle 24 Southeast Corner
This busy street corner by the McDonalds is grimy. It's basically a crowded spot where people wait to cross the street. Across Mission to the west, there's a nice plaza with a busy market. Across 24th Street to the north, another lovely plaza with musicians, preachers, and some places to sit.

You can see a raccoon here.

Calle 24 Southwest Plaza
Little tables and tent-covered booths are scattered throughout this busy plaza, with people selling souvenirs from Mexico and Guatemala, shopping bags, embroidered huipil blouses, woolen ponchos, phone chargers and cases, jewelry, and flowers. Many kinds of music are playing here - norteño blasts its cheerful accordions from speakers at a booth, saxophone notes float up from the huge, round stairwell which goes down to the station, songs blare from passing cars. There is a sloping area useful as a stage underneath the Coffee and Mission mural to the west.

You are underground, on a BART platform. The hollow sound of vibrating train rails echoes through the station. Boxy concrete arches run overhead and then frame the sides of the train tunnel. An elevator is in the median wall to the north. On the platform itself, the floor is covered with long brick-red tiles, while the median walls are tiled in muted orange, gold, and brown, like a desert sunset.
